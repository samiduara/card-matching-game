<footer><h4>The premise of the game is to have a grid of 18 face-down cards. The card faces consist of pairs of matches. Clicking on cards will flip them over, revealing the value. When two are chosen, if it's a match, both cards will disappear. If it's not, the cards will flip back over to face-down. The game should be different every time the game is refreshed.</h4></footer>

<!-- Let's transfer functionality for our reset button to our javascript
  1) Add an event listener to our button, so that when clicked it calls a functon
  2) We'll create a function for our button that gets called when the button
  is clicked -  we'll call it handleReset()
  What should handleReset do? We want it to restart the game
